DBI being maintained by several people now causes a mixture
of styles. It has been proven that people are most productive
when they can do things `ther way'.

Tim Bunce is the owner and main maintainer of DBI. He can and
should veto anything that is forbidden, but for now, you'll
see different styles for the modules that have a single person
responsible for development. You might find a perltidyrc file
for their style in this devel/ directory. When proposing new
features, additions, fixes or documentation, please try to do
so in the style of that specific module.

Perltidy might help.
